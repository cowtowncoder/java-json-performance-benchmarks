# Overview

This project contains a set of performance micro-benchmarks, based on excellent
[JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) package.
Benchmarks exercise JSON reading and/or writing performance of a few popular Java JSON libraries:

* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson](Jackson)
* [https://github.com/google/gson](GSON)

# Status

Somewhat experimental. But has been used with success in optimizing Jackson 2.4 release!
